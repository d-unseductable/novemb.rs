        <h3>Where</h3>

        <p>novemb.rs is a Rust code sprint that is happening in a hybrid fashion, both online and offline. The organisation and two events are run from Berlin and Paris, but we try to grow this.</p>

        <p>Watch this space for further announcements and proposals.</p>

        <p>The goal is to start new projects, work on your current ones or get involved in new ones. The event is open to anyone, but we can provide most support to people in the UTC -1 to UTC +4 timezones, i.e. the European and African continent.</p>

        <p>The event is open to beginners interested in learning Rust while building a small project.</p>

        <p>The Rust community aims to be an inclusive community. People from traditionally underrepresented groups in tech are specifically welcome and invited to join.
        This includes, but is not limited to: non-men, people of color, disabled people, and LGBTQIA+ people.</p>

        <p>For novemb.rs, we are searching:</p>
        <ul>
          <li>People that want to provide a venue at their location for hackers to meet - face to face is always great</li>
          <li>People providing virtual meeting grounds for those not able to attend one of the physical meetings</li>
          <li>Mentors ready to take newcomers questions</li>
          <li>Projects wanting to provide tutoring and help</li>
          <li>People setting up and moderating IRC or other chat channels to make sure newcomers reach the right persons to talk to</li>
        </ul>
